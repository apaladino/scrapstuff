Greetings!

To run the tests, open a command terminal and navigate to the adobe_questions
directory, then compile the java files using the following command:

javac *.java


Then you can run each test with the following command:

java ProgramXX  * XX is the test number.  
   
   ex: java Program112

** NOTE ** Each Program class has the list of required included information in 
           the class level comments at the top. 


Merry Christmas!
